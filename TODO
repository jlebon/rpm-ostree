Core 
----

* Support package installation on top

Treecompose
-----------

* Use libhif
  - Kill repoquery beforehand
* Run mock in a container
  - CLONE_NEWPID | CLONE_NEWNS
  - Mount /proc
  - CLONE_NEWNET ?

Autobuilder
-----------

* Split into separate project
  - treecompose should be Koji plugin
  - Make test system independent
* Split builds into separate tasks
* Figure out why libguestfs is hanging
* Use RPM's idea of %doc for removing docs
* Write an intelligent scheduler
  - Task with same name of newer version wait until old one is done
  - Walk infinite test matrix

Package layering
----------------

* Provide a mechanism for updating packages
* Support pkgs which bring their own pps
  https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/pull/107#issuecomment-205082381
* Support local RPMs installation (though `ostree admin unlock` makes this
  easier now, but it's not carried over)
* Add a way to mark commits as valid for multiple policies rather than creating
  a new commit everytime we relabel
* Related to the above: store the header metadata in the tree itself rather than
  in the commit to avoid duplication across relabeling commits
* Add a --onto option?
